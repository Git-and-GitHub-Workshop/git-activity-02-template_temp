# Git Activity

Welcome to the repository for the second Git activity in Module 1 of the Git and GitHub Workshop. When you accepted the assignment, GitHub forked the template repository and made your copy here to work with.

The repository accompanies Quiz 2 in Canvas. The quiz will ask you questions about the repository, which you can only answer by following the directions within the quiz using this repository.

This activity will also mirror, in some ways, the slides from Dr. Silva's video recording. In that recording, she explored the idea of snapshots using an example pictured below.

Remember, this repo started with a README.md file--maybe this very file you are reading now!

Then a folder called "Animal_functionality" and a Python script, "Animal.py" was added. Since we don't really want to work with Python code in this exercise, we are changing things up a bit and the new file will be a Markdown file, called "Animal.md".

Also note that the commit history, and the resulting snapshots, will be different than the simplified example used in the video.

## Instructions

You should already have the Canvas quiz accompanying this exercise opened; if not, open it now.
